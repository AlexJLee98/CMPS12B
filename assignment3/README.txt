This program takes in all the words and puts it in the bloom filter. From there, it puts the old and new words into the hash table. It reads the input using the lexical analyzer given to us by Darrell. If there is a hit from the input, that means the word is a bad word and it checks the hash table to see if there is a replacement for that word. If not, the word is stored in the joy camp linked list. If there is a replacement, it is stored in the replacement linked list. Upon reaching the end of file, it will print out all the mistakes that you have committed. In order to compile the program, simply type Make. The default settings for the program are no move to front, bloom size is 2^20, and the number of hash entries are 100000. You can change the settings with the different get opt flags.
Make sure to run the program with the “newspeak.txt” and “oldspeak.txt” text files or I will get a segmentation fault and get a 0 on the program :).

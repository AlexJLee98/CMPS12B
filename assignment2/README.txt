The program compares the number of moves and compares it takes for five sources that we were asked to write, min Sort, bubble Sort, insertion Sort, quick Sort, and merge Sort. The description of how each individual sort works are in the comments for each .c file. 
I organized the program by using getopt and organizing the different sorts with different flags.

Files: bubbleSort.c, insertionSort.c, mergeSort.c, minSort.c, quickSort.c, sorting.c,.
Header files: bubbleSort.h, insertionSort.h, mergeSort.h, minSort.h, quickSort.h, sorting.h.

To run the program, just compile it using "make" and typing ./sorting with the flags.
